# Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about billionaires across the world, such as their net worth in billions, age, name, gender, position of the billionaire globally, the year the billionaire’s company was founded, the billionaire’s relationship with the company, whether the billionaire founded the company or if the wealth is affiliated to a political influence, the year the observations were recorded, the industry/sector in which the company belongs, their citizenship, how they acquired their wealth, their wealth category, and geographical region. 

# Research Questions

•	What are the top 10 countries with the highest number of billionaires?

•	What industries/sectors are most successful?

•	What are the main industries with the highest number of women billionaires?

•	What age range represents the highest and lowest number of billionaires?

•	Describe and analyse the additional factors that might influence wealth, e.g., inheritance.

### Hypothesis: 

Null Hypothesis (H0): The industry sector in which a company operates has no significant influence on the net worth of the individuals associated with that company.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The industry sector in which a company operates has a significant influence on the net worth of the individuals associated with that company.

# Technology and Metholody Employed In This Project

I employed Python programming language in the analysis of the dataset provided, and the project was executed in Jupyter notebook, a web based integrated development environment (IDE). Python is free to use and hosts different libraries that support the analysis of data. The python libraries I used in this project are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Statsmodels. NumPy makes it possible to complete essential mathematical operations on arrays and matrices, while Pandas allows to manipulate and analyse data. With the aid of Pandas, it was possible to clean the data and fill missing values. Matplotlib and Seaborn on the other hand, are tools that allow the creation of different plots and visualisations such as line graphs, boxplots, barplots and histograms, barcharts e.t.c. In addition, Statsmodels allows to perform statistical hypotheses testing. Lastly, I carried out the analysis on Jupyter Notebook because it supports the execution of different numerous projects including data science projects. Additionally, the platform is free to use. 

# Methodology

I followed a standard data analysis approach in completing the tasks. After viewing the data to understand its structure and characteristics, I performed data cleaning because some columns contained missing values, data transformation because some data types needed to be changed e.g., converting negative values in ‘age’ column to positive integers, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns and determine correlation between variables, then I answered the research questions and interpreted the results of my findings.

# Evaluation and Future Development

# The Potential Impact of The Results 

•	Conducting analysis on the top countries with the highest number of billionaires could be beneficial to policymakers. Countries with larger number of billionaires could have higher GDP, prospects for investments and start-ups and a more developed economy. These insights could help policymakers in creating policies that foster growth and development in the economy (Chi et al., 2022).

•	Result of the analysis on the most successful industries/sectors can provide information on investment opportunities in various industries which could help investors make informed decisions on where to distribute their resources for optimal yield. It could also provide insight into the industries that are likely to experience growth thereby, providing opportunities for investment.

•	Result of the analysis on the main industries with the highest number of women billionaires can motivate women to pursue their dreams in fields that are usually dominated by men. This could also encourage businesses to create more opportunities for women to succeed in the industries leading to increased diversity and inclusion in the business world.

•	Result of the analysis on additional factors that might influence wealth, such as inheritance, can provide insights into income inequality and social justice. This can help in the establishment of policies that foster more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities for all.
